# Contact List Application

## Overview

**ASP.NET Core**, **cloud deployment (Azure)**, **Redis caching**, **database schema design**, and **unit testing**. It is a basic contact list application that allows users to register, log in, and manage their contacts with full CRUD functionality.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The Classic ASP portion of the application has not been implemented. However, Redis has been integrated for session management, and is configured in a way that supports interoperability with Classic ASP if implemented in the future.

## Features
